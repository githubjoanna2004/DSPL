# Theory 

The sampling theorem, also known as the Nyquist-Shannon theorem, states that a continuous
time signal can be completely reconstructed from its samples if it is sampled at a rate greater 
than twice its highest frequency component, known as the Nyquist rate. Mathematically, if 
the maximum frequency of the signal is fmax,the sampling frequency fs  must satisfy 
fsâ‰¥2fmax  to avoid loss of information and prevent aliasing. 
 
Applications of the Sampling Theorem: 
1. Digital audio processing (e.g., CDs, MP3s) 
2. Digital communication systems 
3. Medical imaging (e.g., MRI, CT scans) 
4. Video compression (e.g., MPEG, HDTV) 
5. Radar and sonar systems
