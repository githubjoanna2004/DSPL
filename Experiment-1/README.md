1.Impulse signal 
 
An impulse signal is a theoretical pulse that is infinitely narrow and happens at a 
specific moment in time, usually at t=0

2.Bipolar Pluse 
A bipolar pulse is a type of signal that alternates between positive and negative amplitude, 
typically with equal magnitudes. It is used in digital communication systems to represent 
binary data, where the positive pulse represents one binary state (e.g., "1") and the negative 
pulse represents the opposite state (e.g., "0"). This alternating pattern helps reduce signal drift 
and minimizes DC offset, making it more efficient for transmission over long distances. 
 
3.Unipolar Pluse 
A unipolar square wave is a periodic signal that alternates between 0 and a positive voltage 
level (e.g., V_max) with abrupt transitions. It has no negative amplitude. The signal is 
typically represented as: 
f(t)=Vmax, for 0 ≤ t < T /2     f(t)=0,  for  T/2  ≤ t< T

Where T is the period of the waveform. 
 
4. Ramp Signal 
A ramp signal is a signal that increases linearly with time, starting from zero. The ramp 
function is denoted as 
                                                    
 
5. Triangular Signal 
A triangular signal is a periodic waveform that alternates between a peak and a trough in a 
linear fashion, forming a triangle-like shape. The rise and fall between the maximum and 
minimum values occur smoothly, resulting in a gradual, consistent slope. 
 
6. Sinusoidal Signal 
A sine signal is a continuous waveform that oscillates smoothly and periodically, following 
the form of a sine or cosine function. Its general form is expressed as: 
 
                                           
where,  
• Ais the amplitude of the signal (the peak value),  
• 𝜔 is the angular frequency in radians per second, where 𝜔 = 2𝜋𝑓, 𝑓 is the frequency in 
Hertz, 
 • t is the time variable 
 • 𝜙 is the phase shift, which determines the initial angle at t=0. 
 
7.Cosine signal A cosine signal is a type of sinusoidal signal that oscillates in a smooth, 
periodic manner over time, following the shape of a cosine function. The general form of a 
cosine signal is given by:  
 Where:  
• A is the amplitude of the signal (the peak value),  
 
 
• 𝜔 is the angular frequency in radians per second, where 𝜔 = 2𝜋𝑓 and f is the frequency in 
Hertz.  
• 𝑡 is the time variable  
• 𝜙 is the phase shift, which determines the initial angle at 𝑡 = 0. 
 
8.Exponential signal 
An exponential signal is a signal whose amplitude varies exponentially with time. It can 
either grow or decay depending on the sign of the exponent. 
generally expressed as 
                                            

 
9.Unit step signal  
is a function that jumps from 0 to 1 at a specified time, typically at t=0.
