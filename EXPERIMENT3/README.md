## THEORY

Linear convolution is a mathematical operation used to determine the output of a linear time
invariant (LTI) system when an input signal is applied. It combines two signals by "sliding" 
one signal over the other and calculating the integral (or sum) of their product at each 
position. 
                                                
                y(t) = x(t) * h(t) = ∫ 𝐱(𝛕)𝐡(𝐭−𝛕) 𝐝𝛕 
                
Linear convolution is fundamental in signal processing for filtering, system analysis, and 
synthesizing output signals based on input and system characteristics. It ensures that the 
output reflects all possible interactions between the input and the system's response. 

Applications of Linear Convolution: 
1. Signal filtering 
2. System analysis 
3. Image processing 
4. Audio processing 
5. Data communication
