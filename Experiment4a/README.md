# Theory 
The sampling theorem, also known as the Nyquist-Shannon theorem, states that a continuous
time signal can be completely reconstructed from its samples if it is sampled at a rate greater 
than twice its highest frequency component, known as the Nyquist rate. Mathematically, if 
the maximum frequency of the signal is fmax,the sampling frequency fs  must satisfy 
fsâ‰¥2fmax  to avoid loss of information and prevent aliasing.
