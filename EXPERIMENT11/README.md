# THEORY

A sine wave can be generated using a Digital Signal Processing (DSP) kit by creating discrete samples of the wave's amplitude over time. This approach uses the basic
trigonometric sine function, typically represented as Asin(2πft+ϕ), where A is the amplitude, fff is the frequency, ttt is time,
and ϕ is the phase. To generate the wave digitally, the DSP system samples points along this curve at a consistent interval, known as the sampling rate, which
must be at least twice the sine wave frequency (Nyquist rate) to accurately reconstruct the waveform. Each sampled point is converted into a digital value and stored,
enabling continuous playback or analysis of the sine wave in digital form. The DSP kit uses this data to recreate the wave, outputting a sequence of voltage changes
that form a smooth sine wave signal, which can then be used in applications like sound synthesis, signal testing, and various communications tasks.
